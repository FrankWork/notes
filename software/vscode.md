Linux
Download Visual Studio Code 64-bit or 32-bit for Linux.
Make a new folder and extract VSCode-linux-x64.zip or VSCode-linux-x32.zip inside that folder.
Double click on Code to run Visual Studio Code.
Tip: If you want to run VS Code from the terminal, create the following link substituting /path/to/vscode/Code with the absolute path to the Code executable:
	sudo ln -s /path/to/vscode/Code /usr/local/bin/code
Now, you can simply type code . in any folder to start editing files in that folder.
